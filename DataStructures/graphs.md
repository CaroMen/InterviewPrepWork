## Graphs

![Graphs](../images/graphs.png)

### Basic Definitions of Graphs
- Order: the number of vertices in the graph
- Size: the number of edges in the graph
- Vertex degree: the number of edges that are incident to a vertex
- Isolated vertex: a vertex that is not connected to any other vertices in the graph
- Directed graph: a graph where all the edges have a direction indicating what is the start vertex and what is end vertex
- Undirected graph: a graph with edges that have no direction
- Weighted graph: edges of the graph have weights
- Unweighted graph: edges of the graph have no weights

## Depth First Search
- With this, we use a stack.
    - This stack can either be our own or the call stack via recursion
